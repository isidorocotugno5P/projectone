#CurryHouse Concept Restaurant 

The CurryHouse website was developed for a concept restaurant that serves different style curries from around the world in a fun, Asian-influenced hygge-style environment, offering branded merchandise and constantly changing menus in order to attract new as well as retain returning customers. This site will be targeted towards customers that value curry-related culture and their stylistic influences, especially from India and Southeast Asia, even if the menu choices are not limited to those areas. These are customers who are looking for an authentic dining experience but do not want to limit themselves to one country's food. CurryHouse hopes to attract dedicated customers to attain a large social media presence through merchandising and recognizable branding. Constantly changing available menu items to retain exclusivity and excitement for returning customers, as well as an incentive for new customers.
